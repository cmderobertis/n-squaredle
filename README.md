# n-Squaredle
~ "The Wordle clone that gets harder as you succeed." ~  
Each game, you must clear a number of boards equal to n+1<sup>2</sup>, where n = your win streak.  
All boards are played simultaneously, and the number of guesses per game is five more than the number of boards.

Thank you, [Josh Wardle](https://github.com/powerlanguage), for the original game that I continue to play daily.
