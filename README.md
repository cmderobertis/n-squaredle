~ n-Squaredle ~ "The Wordle clone that gets harder as you succeed." ~
Each game, you must clear a number of boards equal to your current win streak, plus one, squared.
All boards are played simultaneously, and the number of guesses per game is five more than the number of boards.

This project was adapted from a tutorial provided by FreeCodeCamp.org

Thank you, Josh Wardle, for the original game that I continue to play daily.
